A medical student named Brittany is conducting a preliminary examination on Miss Alexander, who is experiencing neck pain following a minor car accident two days ago. Miss Alexander was rear-ended at a stoplight but did not initially feel pain. The pain, described as tight and dull, began 4-6 hours after the accident and worsens when she bends her head forward or turns it to the left. She has been taking ibuprofen and using ice for relief. Miss Alexander has asthma, takes albuterol and loratadine, and is allergic to penicillin. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day and drinks wine occasionally. Brittany performs a physical exam and some gentle osteopathic treatment to relieve muscle tension. She plans to discuss the findings with Dr. Parrot to develop a treatment plan.
