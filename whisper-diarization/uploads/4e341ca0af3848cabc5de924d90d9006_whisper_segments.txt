0.30 --> 30.22: Jane? Mark? Hi! It's been ages since I last saw you. How are you and Jackie? Yeah, good thanks. And your new baby, George, isn't it? You've got a good memory. Yes, he's two now. What about you? Are you still working in the health centre? Yes, for the time being, but we're moving in a couple of months. Anyhow, I'd better go. I'm late for work. Lovely to see you again. Yeah, likewise. Keep in touch.
