1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,400
Speaker 1: Here, let me help you get these slippers off.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,980
Speaker 1: You did a great job on that walk.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,039
Speaker 0: You sure did, Ms.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,420
Speaker 0: Adams.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,160
Speaker 0: How are you feeling?

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,180
Speaker 2: Well, I'm kind of glad it's over.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,060
Speaker 2: It will get easier, won't it?

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,740
Speaker 1: Oh, it will, hon.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,240
Speaker 1: It will.

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,440
Speaker 0: That's what we're working towards.

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,360
Speaker 0: So if you both look at the board here, it's spelled out.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,140
Speaker 0: Mr.

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:35,760
Speaker 0: Adams, I'm really glad that you're able to be here when we're walking with your wife because I think it's going to give you a better sense of what to expect once you're home and how her recovery is progressing.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,160
Speaker 1: It certainly will.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,640
Speaker 0: Now, we gave her the pain medication an hour before she walked so that she would feel comfortable.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,380
Speaker 0: Then, as you saw, when we got her out of bed, we had her sit on the edge of the bed to make sure she wasn't dizzy from the medications.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,700
Speaker 0: Then we had her stand for a minute to make sure she was okay before she started walking.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,960
Speaker 0: That's going to be important to continue once you're at home.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Speaker 0: And we also talked about how it's important for Ms.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,780
Speaker 0: Adams to get all of her medications on time at home.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,360
Speaker 0: She's on a blood thinner to prevent blood clots, and walking also keeps her blood circulating and will prevent clotting as well.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like that little calendar you showed me that has all the times charted out.

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,480
Speaker 1: But, you know, I'm not sure either.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,120
Speaker 1: one of us is clear on the dose of each medicine.

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,160
Speaker 2: He's right about that.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,880
Speaker 0: I'm really glad you told me this.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,620
Speaker 0: This is exactly the kind of information I need to know.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,360
Speaker 0: I'll go over the doses now and we'll review them again when Ms.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,660
Speaker 0: Adams is discharged.

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,900
Speaker 0: Plus I have some printed materials to give you when you go home as well.

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,720
Speaker 1: Thanks.

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:50,960
Speaker 1: That'll be really helpful.
