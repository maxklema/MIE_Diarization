**Patient Summary:**

- **Main Complaint:** Miss Alexander is experiencing significant neck pain.
- **Relevant History:** The pain began approximately two days ago following a minor car accident where she was rear-ended at a stoplight. She did not initially feel pain and did not visit the hospital.
- **Symptoms:** The pain is described as tight and dull, primarily located at the back and sides of the neck. It worsens when bending the head forward or turning to the left. The pain is constant and rated 6-7 out of 10.
- **Self-Treatment:** She has been taking ibuprofen (two tablets every six hours) and applying ice, which provided minimal relief.
- **Medical History:** She has asthma, for which she takes albuterol, and is allergic to penicillin (causes a rash). She also takes loratadine for allergies and a multivitamin.
- **Lifestyle:** She smokes about half a pack of cigarettes a day and occasionally drinks wine.
- **Physical Exam:** The exam revealed tenderness throughout the neck and limited range of motion. Reflexes and strength were tested, and a gentle osteopathic treatment was performed to relieve muscle tension.
- **Next Steps:** The medical student will discuss the findings with Dr. Parrot to develop a treatment plan. Miss Alexander is advised to return if the osteopathic treatment provides relief, for potentially more aggressive treatment.
