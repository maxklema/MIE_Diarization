**Patient Summary:**

- **Main Complaint:** The patient, Miss Alexander, is experiencing significant neck pain.
- **Relevant History:** The pain began approximately two days ago following a minor car accident where she was rear-ended at a stoplight. She did not initially feel pain and did not visit the hospital.
- **Symptoms:** The pain is described as a tight, dull ache located at the back and sides of the neck. It worsens when bending the head forward or turning to the left. The pain is constant and rated as a 6 or 7 out of 10.
- **Self-Treatment:** The patient has been taking ibuprofen (two tablets every six hours) and applying ice, which has provided some relief.
- **Medical History:** The patient has asthma, for which she takes albuterol, and is allergic to penicillin (causes a rash). She also takes loratadine for allergies and a multivitamin.
- **Lifestyle:** The patient smokes about half a pack of cigarettes a day and occasionally drinks alcohol. She works as an administrative assistant and enjoys cooking and gardening.
- **Physical Exam:** The exam revealed tenderness throughout the neck and limited range of motion. Reflexes and strength tests were performed, and a gentle myofascial treatment was applied to relieve muscle tension.
- **Next Steps:** The medical student will discuss the findings with Dr. Parrot to develop a treatment plan. The patient is advised to return if the gentle treatment provides relief, for potentially more aggressive therapy. No immediate questions or concerns were raised by the patient.
