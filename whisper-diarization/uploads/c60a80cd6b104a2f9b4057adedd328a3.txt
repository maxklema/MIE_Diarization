Speaker 1: Here, let me help you get these slippers off.  You did a great job on that walk.  

Speaker 0: You sure did, Ms.  Adams.  How are you feeling?  

Speaker 2: Well, I'm kind of glad it's over.  It will get easier, won't it?  

Speaker 1: Oh, it will, hon.  It will.  

Speaker 0: That's what we're working towards.  So if you both look at the board here, it's spelled out.  Mr.  Adams, I'm really glad that you're able to be here when we're walking with your wife because I think it's going to give you a better sense of what to expect once you're home and how her recovery is progressing.  

Speaker 1: It certainly will.  

Speaker 0: Now, we gave her the pain medication an hour before she walked so that she would feel comfortable.  Then, as you saw, when we got her out of bed, we had her sit on the edge of the bed to make sure she wasn't dizzy from the medications.  Then we had her stand for a minute to make sure she was okay before she started walking.  That's going to be important to continue once you're at home.  And we also talked about how it's important for Ms.  Adams to get all of her medications on time at home.  She's on a blood thinner to prevent blood clots, and walking also keeps her blood circulating and will prevent clotting as well.  

Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like that little calendar you showed me that has all the times charted out.  But, you know, I'm not sure either.  one of us is clear on the dose of each medicine.  

Speaker 2: He's right about that.  

Speaker 0: I'm really glad you told me this.  This is exactly the kind of information I need to know.  I'll go over the doses now and we'll review them again when Ms.  Adams is discharged.  Plus, I have some printed materials to give you when you go home as well.  

Speaker 1: Thanks.  That'll be really helpful.
