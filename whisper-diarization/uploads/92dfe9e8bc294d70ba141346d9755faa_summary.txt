**Patient Summary:**

- **Main Complaint:** Miss Alexander is experiencing significant neck pain.
- **Relevant History:** The pain began two days ago following a minor car accident where she was rear-ended at a stoplight. She was wearing a seatbelt and did not initially feel pain, which started 4-6 hours post-accident.
- **Symptoms:** The pain is described as tight and dull, primarily at the back and sides of the neck, worsening when bending forward or turning to the left. Pain is rated 6-7 out of 10 and is constant but worsens with certain movements. No numbness, tingling, or radiating pain to the arms.
- **Self-Treatment:** Miss Alexander has been taking ibuprofen (two tablets every six hours) and applying ice, which provided minimal relief.
- **Medical History:** She has asthma, managed with albuterol, and is allergic to penicillin (causes rash). She also takes loratadine for allergies and a multivitamin.
- **Lifestyle:** She smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol occasionally. She works as an administrative assistant and enjoys cooking and gardening, though gardening has been difficult due to neck pain.
- **Physical Exam:** The exam revealed tenderness throughout the neck and limited range of motion. Reflexes and strength tests were normal. A gentle osteopathic treatment was performed to relieve muscle tension.
- **Next Steps:** The medical student will discuss findings with Dr. Parrot to develop a treatment plan. Miss Alexander is advised to return if she experiences relief from the initial treatment for further, possibly more aggressive, therapy.
