1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,020
Speaker 1: If you're applying to medicine in the UK, you're probably wondering what an online interview is actually like.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:16,640
Speaker 1: Although there are lots of resources and they can tell you what subjects are going to come up, there's nothing out there that's going to show you from your perspective what you're going to experience when you go through your online medicine interview.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:29,800
Speaker 1: Until now I've managed to get permission to share with you a real interview and from the point of view of the interviewee what it's going to feel like the kind of thing that's going to happen and what happens when you do an online interview.

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,840
Speaker 1: exactly the progression and how it feels, how it happens, so that you can prepare and know exactly what's coming.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,480
Speaker 1: If you want some help and have an interview like this simulated, reach out to us because we're doing an interview crash course to get people ready.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:52,620
Speaker 1: But for now, you can watch this video where you can see exactly what an interview is like, enjoy, try and learn from it as much as possible, and hopefully it can help prepare you for your real interview on the day.

7
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,700
Speaker 1: So you're going to see everything as the interviewee sees it.

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,340
Speaker 1: So the questions as they pop up, the stations as they rotate.

9
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,940
Speaker 1: through them, the different panels as they move through those.

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,680
Speaker 1: But otherwise, I hope you find this useful.

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,340
Speaker 1: Let's see if from going through the video, you can guess which university this interview belongs to.

12
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,940
Speaker 1: But otherwise, enjoy, and I will see you at the end.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:32,920
Speaker 3: So your first question is, can you tell us about a time when you've disagreed with someone at home, school or work?

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,780
Speaker 3: So what happened and how was it resolved?

15
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,500
Speaker 0: I guess I have a pretty good example for this.

16
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,580
Speaker 0: I have a pretty close personal friend.

17
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,160
Speaker 0: We've been friends for a few years now, I think probably six, seven, eight years.

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,340
Speaker 0: And he was quite strongly against taking the Covid vaccinations.

19
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,740
Speaker 0: And it was just the COVID vaccination specifically.

20
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,620
Speaker 0: He's not anti-vaxxed.

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,260
Speaker 0: He's had his shots when he was younger.

22
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:07,260
Speaker 0: But when this came up, obviously it had been coming up quite a lot throughout COVID.

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,300
Speaker 0: You know, we're saying you need to get your vaccines.

24
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,139
Speaker 0: There's people falling ill.

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,880
Speaker 0: You might fall ill.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,980
Speaker 0: We're concerned for you.

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:25,640
Speaker 0: And throughout literally the last whole two years he's just been saying no i'm not getting vaccinated i'm not doing it and from from my understanding now it's just because he's against Pfizer and these big pharmaceutical companies.

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:36,300
Speaker 0: he has some kind of uh predisposition against feeding into these mega pharmaceutical companies and obviously me being the medical friend in the group i've.

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,960
Speaker 0: i've tried to speak to him separately like out away from everyone else.

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,020
Speaker 0: like you know this is this is going to be good for your health.

31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:55,040
Speaker 0: i understand that you might have these uh you might have these problems with these companies but at the end of the day it's it's fair and good and you know it's not like you don't interact with these sort of companies in another scenario.

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,580
Speaker 0: for example he uses instagram and in my opinion that could be just as harmful or more harmful than feeding it to Pfizer.

33
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:14,840
Speaker 0: honestly and you know what we we did have a big conversation about this and we did go back and forth but uh at the end of the day I recognized that he was just so steady like he was so stuck in his view.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Speaker 0: there wasn't really anything I could say to him that would be able to convince him otherwise and unfortunately he still hasn't got his vaccine and as a result he didn't manage to go on a trip with the rest of the group to Europe.

35
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:40,620
Speaker 0: so he was left out during that and that was quite unfortunate that I haven't been able to convince him but I recognized that if I kept pushing and trying to get him to do this honestly like we've been going on for two years.

36
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:48,040
Speaker 0: it's not going to change anything and i didn't want to keep patronizing him because clearly he wasn't going to change his mind which is quite unfortunate.

37
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 3: honestly thank you and obviously from this example you kind of said that unfortunately it didn't work out.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,320
Speaker 3: um but why do you think it's kind of important for doctors to need to be able to be good at working with other people?

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:19,579
Speaker 0: yeah well i think um it's important to be able to work with difficult patients just because at the end of the day as doctors we're trying to work in their best interest and sometimes they may be difficult simply because they don't understand the situation.

40
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:40,840
Speaker 0: so it's important to make sure that the patient that you're speaking to fully understands you know what's going on with them what options they have available and what's happened so far so that they fully understand the situation and then that then they might be able to come to see what you're saying as the doctor, what recommendations you're making.

41
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
Speaker 0: They might be able to understand it a bit better.

42
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,180
Speaker 0: And as the doctor, you're just there to be the caregiver.

43
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,100
Speaker 0: You're not there to change ideologies.

44
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,340
Speaker 0: You're just there to help improve the health of a patient.

45
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:20,040
Speaker 0: So obviously, if they're very um strongly against an idea for example just because of religious background or some kind of something that's happened in that past um I think it's it's good to be able to deal with that without um becoming uh without bringing uh um sorry without angering the patient.

46
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,360
Speaker 0: I think it's important to be able to explain this like explain your viewpoint correctly and in a way that they can understand so that they can potentially bring down the level.

47
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,060
Speaker 0: because if they understand the situation, if they understand you're there to help them, then they're less likely to be difficult.

48
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,420
Speaker 0: Thank you.

49
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:44,900
Speaker 3: And my last question is can the doctor ever have too much empathy and respect for a patient's views?

50
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,900
Speaker 0: Too much empathy and respect for a patient's views.

51
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,160
Speaker 0: I think definitely too much respect for a patient's views.

52
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,180
Speaker 0: I can see that happening.

53
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:07,200
Speaker 0: For example, if it's something relatively minor, like oh I'm scared of needles I don't want to get this injection and then the doctor's like okay you don't want you don't want it okay we won't do it.

54
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,600
Speaker 0: I think that's that's that's a bit too far.

55
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,860
Speaker 0: in that case it's kind of unreasonable.

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,000
Speaker 0: where like if if you haven't asked to see you know why?

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,180
Speaker 0: why are you scared of these needles.

58
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,880
Speaker 0: why do you not want it?

59
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:40,660
Speaker 0: if you just sign if you just straight away conform to whatever the patient wants without finding out why or finding out what the reasons are then it can be harmful because at the end of the day you know potentially this injection could have been very helpful for I don't know finding out some more details about the condition that they have or something else along those lines.

60
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,640
Speaker 0: And in terms of too much empathy, that's a difficult question honestly.

61
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,060
Speaker 0: I think it can become a problem at some point.

62
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,820
Speaker 2: Obviously, if you're- Hi, sorry, I'm gonna have to take- Sorry.

63
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,220
Speaker 0: Okay, that's fine.

64
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,860
Speaker 0: Sorry.

65
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,120
Speaker 2: For the next question, it's a hypothetical scenario, so I'm going to read out to you first.

66
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,460
Speaker 0: Okay, great.

67
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,400
Speaker 2: One of the junior doctors on a hospital ward.

68
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:20,900
Speaker 2: The day after his surgery, a 70-year-old man is transferred to intensive care with a life-threatening pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the chest.

69
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:31,580
Speaker 2: During a routine meeting, the consultant reviewing the complication identifies that one of the junior doctors has failed to prescribe the medication required to prevent this type of blood clot.

70
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:41,000
Speaker 2: So the question is, firstly, how will you respond personally, knowing that your lack of action has had serious implications for a real person?

71
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:51,200
Speaker 0: Well, I think I believe it's called duty of candle where it's expected of a doctor to be on about their mistakes.

72
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:03,360
Speaker 0: So I think especially if I was in this situation personally, I would make sure to say to the consultant and when appropriate to the patient, look I've made this mistake, I failed to prescribe this medicine, this is on me.

73
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,680
Speaker 0: So yeah, I think I would go to the consultant and explain that and I think it's important to earn up in that situation because it's quite serious.

74
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,600
Speaker 0: Or even if it wasn't serious, I think it's important to earn up just for the sake of clarity.

75
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:28,880
Speaker 2: And you partly answered this, but just in case you had anything else to add to it, why do you think it's important for doctors to delay this duty of Canva, so earning up to their mistakes?

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's important in, I think, two main ways.

77
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,100
Speaker 0: So one being transparency to the patient and the public.

78
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:50,500
Speaker 0: It ensures, or it helps ensure that the patients trust the doctors because if they've made a mistake and they're trying to cover it up or they're not making it obvious or they're just not telling you as a patient, then they're going to.

79
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:59,300
Speaker 0: they're going to lose trust because obviously you've gone and made a mistake and then you're not telling them they're just next time they might not even come to the doctors because they they've.

80
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,100
Speaker 0: they've had bad experiences in the past.

81
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,960
Speaker 0: now they won't trust the doctors because they think oh they're just going to lie to me or they're just not going to help me because they made a mistake last time.

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,520
Speaker 0: and it's also important in terms of I think your own self-improvement as well.

83
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:25,340
Speaker 0: you need to be honest with that mistake and being able to be honest with that will help you improve in the future because then people can help correct you with that.

84
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:48,840
Speaker 0: And I guess as well, it would be important for the sake of the patient and that specific scenario and the care that you're going to deliver to the patient because if you've made a mistake, for example, I guess it's not exactly the scenario, but if you've given the wrong prescription rather than not a prescription at all, then it might have different side effects and different interactions with some sort of other care that you might have to provide to the patient.

85
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,180
Speaker 0: So yeah, I think there are definitely multiple reasons that you should have to be as clear as you can with any mistakes that you make.

86
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,400
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

87
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,440
Speaker 2: Your next question is how would you inform your fellow staff members?

88
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,520
Speaker 2: So following on about the scenario that I read at the start.

89
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:17,420
Speaker 0: Okay, so I think, as I said, I would probably go first to the consultant just because he's the one that highlighted the problem in the first place.

90
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:40,100
Speaker 0: And yeah, after I've spoken to him, unless he's already made this disclosure that I've made the mistake, I think maybe, I'm not sure if this would be the most appropriate place as Obviously, I haven't been in the scenario myself, but potentially at the next MDT meeting, because then everyone that's concerned with that patient's care is going to be present.

91
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,620
Speaker 0: And then you can be completely honest with everyone, look, I've made this mistake, this is what's happened as a result of my mistake.

92
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,480
Speaker 0: And then everyone who's concerned will be enlightened as to the situation.

93
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:02,640
Speaker 0: we can move forward there with dealing with the problem and everyone can work together as the MDT to be able to provide the best care considering the situation that's happened.

94
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

95
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,680
Speaker 2: And have you ever made any mistakes that have impacted other people?

96
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,800
Speaker 2: And how did you overcome this?

97
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:27,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I made a mistake back in, it was during my A-levels, so I As I would often read ahead in class, I would be quite well informed as to the subjects that we're covering and especially during tests.

98
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,760
Speaker 0: that would help me out quite a lot.

99
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Speaker 0: And as a result, my friends that I had in the subjects, they would come to me for help with revision or if they found something particularly difficult, they'd say, hey, can you explain this to me or can you help me with this question?

100
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:49,980
Speaker 0: So what ended up happening, I think this was, I believe it was to do with muscles, there's like two marks at the very end of this paper.

101
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,060
Speaker 0: And the teacher told us beforehand because we hadn't covered it in class at the time, but they still gave us the question for whatever reason.

102
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,060
Speaker 0: And the teacher was like, okay, go look and learning, go look, go and learn it yourself.

103
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
Speaker 0: And obviously my friends came to me and said, look, this is, you've already covered this.

104
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,460
Speaker 0: Can you help us with this?

105
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,120
Speaker 0: And said, of course.

106
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

107
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,640
Speaker 0: So I sat down and then I talked to them through it.

108
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,560
Speaker 0: I explained the process and when it came to doing the exam, I thought it was pretty all right.

109
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,580
Speaker 0: I got the marks at the end of the day, but then um they came and spoke to me afterwards and said you told us the wrong thing.

110
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,860
Speaker 0: we all of us got zero marks on that question and obviously at that point I I felt really bad because you know I've gone and told the wrong thing.

111
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,260
Speaker 0: so I made sure uh to get get all of them together again and uh see what the answers they put.

112
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
Speaker 0: and then I also asked the teacher can you come and help us with this just because I tried to explain this and I did it wrong.

113
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,140
Speaker 0: so I want to make sure that I'm right this time.

114
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,740
Speaker 0: can you come and help us with this?

115
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,140
Speaker 0: um As well as that.

116
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,660
Speaker 0: So yeah, I got all of their answers together and made sure to see what they said.

117
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,600
Speaker 0: I also asked the teacher for the mark scheme so I could see what the mark scheme wanted me to say.

118
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,220
Speaker 0: And I also had the textbook and spec up at the time, just so we could make sure that 100% that we've got this right for the next time.

119
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,680
Speaker 0: Thank you.

120
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,400
Speaker 0: Thank you.

121
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,920
Speaker 4: Thank you.

122
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,780
Speaker 4: So the first question is what are your qualities that would make me want you as my doctor?

123
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,720
Speaker 0: Okay, can I just have a second to think about it?

124
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,600
Speaker 0: Of course.

125
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,000
Speaker 0: okay i think i'm ready to come out.

126
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,480
Speaker 0: okay okay.

127
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,700
Speaker 0: so first and foremost i think i'm quite an empathetic person.

128
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,200
Speaker 0: i believe that i will be able to facilitate your needs as best as i can.

129
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:16,240
Speaker 0: i'll try to understand the situation that you're in and taking into account all of the everything about you so that i can provide the best care to you and in light of all the resources and everything that we have access to in that scenario.

130
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,040
Speaker 0: Furthermore, I'm quite an academic person and I enjoy learning.

131
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,240
Speaker 0: I will use that to make sure that I do the best of my abilities during my time at medical school to become the best doctor that I can.

132
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,100
Speaker 0: And throughout my career as a doctor, I will continue to develop my skills so that I'm up to date on the best information that we have available at the time.

133
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,100
Speaker 0: And I would use this to make educated decisions and recommendations about your care.

134
00:14:45,220 --> 00:15:01,620
Speaker 0: and yeah I think overall I will put you at the center of everything and make sure to keep you informed about all decisions that we make about your care and make sure that you're involved throughout the entire process so that you're informed, sorry, so that you're able to make the best decisions that you believe are appropriate for you.

135
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,520
Speaker 4: Okay yeah so you've mentioned some good qualities there like empathy, can you describe how you demonstrate these qualities?

136
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:20,600
Speaker 0: Yeah so One scenario in which I think I've demonstrated empathy is during some working experience I completed during last summer.

137
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:33,060
Speaker 0: I was at a care home for a week or so and during this time I was speaking with the residents there, building relationships with them, and one resident in particular stood up to me.

138
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,720
Speaker 0: This elderly lady, she happened to be from Bangladesh and As a result, she only spoke Bengali.

139
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,320
Speaker 0: She didn't speak very much English.

140
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,700
Speaker 0: I think all the English I heard her speak during my time there was asking for a spoon.

141
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,780
Speaker 0: Luckily, I'm also from Bangladesh and I can also speak Bengali.

142
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:24,080
Speaker 0: So I did spend quite a lot of time speaking with her, finding out about her situation and, you know, just having spending some time with her because as she told me, she was becoming incredibly isolated, none of the carers there could speak Bengali, none of the residents there could speak Bengali and her daughters, I think she had two daughters both in uni age, they rarely came to visit and she'd been there for years and I just can't imagine how awful it would have been to be sat there for years and barely having anyone to speak to throughout the day.

143
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaker 0: so I made sure that during my time there I would make sure to see that she's okay and be able to provide any help that I can.

144
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,380
Speaker 0: I'll ask if she's feeling okay, if she wants some food or she wants some help from a specific carer.

145
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,220
Speaker 4: That sounds like a good display of empathy.

146
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,340
Speaker 4: But what qualities do you have that you think could could impair your performance as a doctor and how would you deal with those?

147
00:16:49,660 --> 00:17:08,140
Speaker 0: I think something that is kind of something that might affect me in the future is I haven't really had to deal with any kind of significant I guess in this specific scenario of me being a doctor I've had to deal with a patient's death.

148
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:17,119
Speaker 0: that's been my responsibility obviously me just being a gap year student at the moment but it's something that I look forward.

149
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:46,740
Speaker 0: I see forward to that being a potential scenario in the future and it is something that's potentially kind of scary as obviously I haven't had to deal with something like that before but I believe that I tend to be able to make the best use of the resources I have access to and I recognize that there are support groups that I can speak to if I have any problems with these and obviously I can speak to my colleagues, friends and family if I'm having any particular struggles to deal with these sort of things that I'll be able to talk it out and I'll be able to deal with it better.

150
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,480
Speaker 4: And is that the thing you think you'd find the hardest about being a doctor?

151
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,800
Speaker 4: was anything else you think you'd find hard about being a doctor?

152
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if it's what I would say I'd find the hardest.

153
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,300
Speaker 0: obviously I don't know what it's like to be a doctor.

154
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,780
Speaker 0: I'm not a doctor yet so but I do recognize there are multiple things that can be difficult about the job.

155
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,960
Speaker 0: something that I've had a bit of experience with during some other work experience at the hospital, local hospital.

156
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:24,900
Speaker 0: I spent quite a lot of time at A&E shadowing some doctors there and the pressure of the situation was very obvious and very upfront.

157
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,200
Speaker 0: It was quite clear that everyone was under pressure, everyone's very stressed out, there's so many things going on.

158
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,980
Speaker 0: So that is something that I did notice quite a lot during my time there.

159
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:48,380
Speaker 0: However, I feel I've generally dealt with stress quite well in my previous years, such as during my A-levels and GCSEs through physical activity or my own hobbies.

160
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,620
Speaker 4: We'll move on to the next question now, thank you.

161
00:18:51,640 --> 00:19:07,020
Speaker 3: For the next question, it is can a doctor or medical student be opposed to COVID vaccination?

162
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:31,440
Speaker 0: I believe if you would like to go into work at the moment in the UK you are required to have your COVID vaccinations and this is just because for the sake of the patient obviously if you're a doctor or a medical student you're constantly being exposed to so many different patients in a hospital where it's likely that you're going to be exposed to someone potentially with COVID.

163
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:45,500
Speaker 0: It's important to be vaccinated so that if you do happen to become exposed to it and catch COVID you're going to be less symptomatic and therefore less likely to be able to pass it on to someone else later down that line.

164
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:56,260
Speaker 0: and that's important because obviously there are going to be different patients who are vaccinated and who aren't and most importantly it's going to be for those patients who aren't vaccinated for whatever reason they happen to have.

165
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:07,000
Speaker 0: because if you as a doctor are going around passing COVID to patients obviously that's I guess it would be going against your non-maleficence political autonomy because you are pretty much directly just causing harm.

166
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:17,880
Speaker 0: I believe that I've, I mean, I have a close personal friend who's quite, who hasn't taken their COVID vaccines, they're just quite against that general idea.

167
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,620
Speaker 0: They're not anti-vax, they've had vaccinations in the past, but they're specifically against COVID vaccines.

168
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:31,740
Speaker 0: They have some kind of predisposed disliking for Pfizer and those big pharmaceutical companies.

169
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,380
Speaker 0: So they've chosen not to get COVID vaccines and I've had a bit of experience dealing with that.

170
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:50,340
Speaker 0: However, I think in this scenario, if you're a medical student or a doctor, it's pretty much, it's unexcusable not to have your vaccines as you're always dealing with these patients and you need to be, I think, trying to practice what you preach.

171
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:59,980
Speaker 0: If you're trying to practice good health, you should be getting the most updated vaccines and Obviously you're going to be recommending that patients get vaccines for their own health.

172
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Speaker 3: OK, so you've mentioned some really good points about COVID vaccines and why doctors should have them.

173
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,640
Speaker 3: So another question is why is it compulsory for doctors to be vaccinated against hepatitis B?

174
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,120
Speaker 0: So hepatitis B in particular isn't something I'm too familiar with.

175
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,540
Speaker 0: especially considering it's not on any kind of bcc level spec that I've experienced in the past.

176
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:38,620
Speaker 0: From my limited understanding I believe it can be passed on through blood contact or some kind of bodily fluid contact.

177
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:52,120
Speaker 0: and if it can be transmitted through that kind of process, being a doctor it would mean that because you know you might have to take blood samples or from multiple different patients during a day or throughout your life or your career.

178
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:04,560
Speaker 0: it would one mean that you're incredibly more likely to be exposed to that kind of thing compared to the average person just because you're seeing so many different people and you're having to take these blood samples.

179
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:14,880
Speaker 0: and two it's going to also make it more likely that you're going to pass it on to someone just because when you're taking these samples then there's more likely a higher chance of there being contact that can result in transmission.

180
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,420
Speaker 3: Thank you very much.

181
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,140
Speaker 3: Another question I have for you is how freely can a doctor express their personal views?

182
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,980
Speaker 0: I believe that it should be.

183
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,680
Speaker 0: they should judge the situation and do it appropriately.

184
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:42,900
Speaker 0: I think that sometimes it can be appropriate for example if a patient says to them you know I'm unsure what decision to make here, doc.

185
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,940
Speaker 0: What do you think I should do?

186
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,340
Speaker 0: I think in that case, it's very appropriate.

187
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,680
Speaker 0: You know, they're clearly asking for your opinion and they want some expert opinion in this situation.

188
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,760
Speaker 0: And I think in that case, then it would be kind of rude not to give your opinion.

189
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,580
Speaker 0: However, there are definitely situations where you shouldn't.

190
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:18,460
Speaker 0: For example, I don't know if there's a patient who's transgender, for example, I think it would be quite appropriate for a doctor to just kind of out of nowhere mention, oh I'm part of the support group that helps deal with people coming to terms with their birth gender.

191
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:35,640
Speaker 0: I think in that case it would be very inappropriate and potentially even harmful to the patient and especially the patient-doctor relationship because the patient will become offended and probably become offended in that scenario and it would probably lead to a breakdown of trust and just cause further harm to that patient.

192
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:47,540
Speaker 0: So, does a doctor have a duty to be a role model?

193
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would say that doctors have a duty to be a role model.

194
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:59,900
Speaker 0: I think being in a position to be able to give care, I think it's quite a privileged position and it's important that one of the...

195
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,800
Speaker 1: So there we have it.

196
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,760
Speaker 1: Did you guess which university that interview belonged to?

197
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,720
Speaker 1: If so, pop it in the comments and I'll tell you if you're right.

198
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,860
Speaker 1: I hope you can see exactly what that's like now.

199
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,440
Speaker 1: So you can see it kind of is a bit awkward at the start.

200
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
Speaker 1: There's some brief introductions but they just dive straight in.

201
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,900
Speaker 1: They'll cut you off halfway through.

202
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:26,240
Speaker 1: When you're ending with that particular breakout room and you move on to the next set of people, it just abruptly ends and they move you on.

203
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,140
Speaker 1: So just be prepared for exactly that sort of thing.

204
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:36,460
