Speaker 0: Jane?  

Speaker 1: Mark?  Hi!  It's been ages since I last saw you.  How are you and Jackie?  

Speaker 0: Yeah, good thanks.  

Speaker 1: And your new baby, George, isn't it?  

Speaker 0: You've got a good memory.  Yes, he's two now.  What about you?  Are you still working in the health centre?  

Speaker 1: Yes, for the time being, but we're moving in a couple of months.  Anyhow, I'd better go.  I'm late for work.  Lovely to see you again.  

Speaker 0: Yeah, likewise.  Keep in touch.
