A medical student named Brittany, working with Dr. Parrot, conducts an initial assessment of Miss Alexander, who is experiencing neck pain following a minor car accident two days prior. Miss Alexander describes the pain as tight and dull, primarily at the back and sides of her neck, worsening when bending forward or turning left. She has been taking ibuprofen and using ice for relief, but the pain persists. Brittany gathers Miss Alexander's medical history, noting her asthma, penicillin allergy, and lifestyle habits. After a physical exam and gentle osteopathic treatment, Brittany plans to discuss the findings with Dr. Parrot to develop a treatment plan. Miss Alexander's main concern is to alleviate her pain.
