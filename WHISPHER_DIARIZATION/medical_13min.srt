1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,980
Speaker 0: You may knock and enter the room.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,720
Speaker 0: Come in.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,820
Speaker 0: Hi Miss Alexander.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,220
Speaker 0: Hi.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,160
Speaker 0: Hi, my name is Brittany and I'm a medical student working with Dr.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,160
Speaker 0: Parrot today.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,600
Speaker 0: Try to get this all rubbed in.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,180
Speaker 0: It's nice to meet you.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,940
Speaker 1: Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:33,700
Speaker 0: So she has sent me in just to ask you some questions and do a brief physical exam and then I will step back out and talk to her and then she'll be in behind me.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,480
Speaker 0: Is that okay?

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,160
Speaker 0: Great.

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,620
Speaker 0: So what brings you in today?

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,660
Speaker 1: I've been having pretty bad neck pain.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,760
Speaker 0: Oh goodness.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,020
Speaker 0: Well I'm glad you came in so we can take a look and make sure there's nothing going on.

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,800
Speaker 0: So how long has this been going on?

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
Speaker 1: Probably about two days.

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,680
Speaker 1: Okay.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Speaker 0: Did anything happen a couple days ago out of the ordinary?

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,580
Speaker 1: Well I was in a small car accident.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,140
Speaker 0: Okay.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,480
Speaker 0: Must have been scary.

25
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,800
Speaker 0: What happened?

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,960
Speaker 1: I was at a stoplight and the person behind me rear-ended me.

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,300
Speaker 1: We weren't going very fast though.

29
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,400
Speaker 1: I think he was maybe going five or ten miles an hour.

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,940
Speaker 0: And were you wearing your seat belt at the time?

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,400
Speaker 0: And so you said you didn't go to the hospital or anything because you didn't feel any pain initially?

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,140
Speaker 1: No.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,980
Speaker 0: So when exactly did the pain start?

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,960
Speaker 0: About how many hours after the accident?

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,320
Speaker 1: I would probably say maybe four to six hours after.

37
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,580
Speaker 1: I think maybe I was just in shock at first and so I didn't really feel any pain or anything.

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,800
Speaker 0: All right.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,760
Speaker 0: And where is it bothering you specifically?

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,040
Speaker 0: Can you pinpoint a specific area on your neck?

41
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,320
Speaker 1: It's mostly just the back of my neck and on the sides of my neck.

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,320
Speaker 0: Both sides?

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,620
Speaker 2: Yes.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,940
Speaker 0: And did you hear any pops or have any numbness or tingling that occurred during the accident?

45
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,180
Speaker 1: No.

46
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,280
Speaker 0: And is there anything that's making the pain worse?

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,160
Speaker 1: Mostly when I bend my head forward and try to turn it to the left, it kind of...

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,300
Speaker 0: It's really tight.

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,100
Speaker 0: Anything you've noticed that's helping it?

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,840
Speaker 1: I took some ibuprofen and I put ice.

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,080
Speaker 1: on the back of my neck and that helped a little bit but it still hurts.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Speaker 0: It still hurts.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,420
Speaker 0: And how much ibuprofen are you taking?

54
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,380
Speaker 1: I took two tablets every six hours or so since then.

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Speaker 0: I'm just taking some notes so that way when I go talk to Dr.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,180
Speaker 0: Parrott I can be thorough and let her know everything you're telling me.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,480
Speaker 0: So it's worse whenever you're bending forward and to the side, to the left.

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,860
Speaker 0: Is that correct?

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,220
Speaker 0: Yes.

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,860
Speaker 2: Alright.

61
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,740
Speaker 0: And can you describe the pain to me?

62
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,640
Speaker 1: It just feels like a tight, kind of dull pain.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,380
Speaker 2: Okay.

64
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,600
Speaker 0: So tight and dull.

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,980
Speaker 0: And is this pain radiating or moving anywhere?

66
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,500
Speaker 1: Not really, it just goes... up and down the back of my neck.

67
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,880
Speaker 0: So nothing coming down into the arms?

68
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,040
Speaker 1: No.

69
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,240
Speaker 0: And on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, where would you say you're at?

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,200
Speaker 1: Probably around a 6 or a 7 out of 10, especially when I try and bend forward and turn my head.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
Speaker 0: And is it a constant pain?

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,780
Speaker 0: Yes.

73
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,340
Speaker 0: But it'll get worse whenever you bend forward and turn to the left.

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,520
Speaker 0: And would you say since the accident, since that evening, has it been constant, or is it getting worse, better?

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,440
Speaker 0: What would you say?

76
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,980
Speaker 1: It feels like it's getting worse, but I don't know if that's because the ibuprofen's not working.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Speaker 0: Well, I'm glad you came in.

78
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:20,519
Speaker 0: The over-the-counter stuff's not working, and we can do an exam and make sure there's nothing we're missing, and if we need to.

79
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,260
Speaker 0: possibly do some osteopathic treatments and we'll get on to that later, okay?

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,720
Speaker 1: Okay.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,380
Speaker 0: And as far as your past medical history, have you ever had a neck injury before?

82
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:36,920
Speaker 0: No.

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,720
Speaker 0: So you've never had problems with your neck?

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:38,980
Speaker 1: No.

85
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,820
Speaker 0: Okay, that's good to know.

86
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,640
Speaker 0: And any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for or that you've ever been treated for?

87
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,880
Speaker 1: I have asthma.

88
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,760
Speaker 1: I take medicine for that.

89
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,200
Speaker 1: Okay.

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Speaker 1: That's about it.

91
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,180
Speaker 0: Ever been hospitalized?

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,060
Speaker 1: No.

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,840
Speaker 0: Ever had any surgeries?

94
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,260
Speaker 1: I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid.

95
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,460
Speaker 1: I think I was probably nine.

96
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,720
Speaker 0: Okay.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,240
Speaker 0: And as far as medications, you said you take the over-the-counter ibuprofen and then you take something for asthma.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,380
Speaker 0: What do you take for your asthma?

99
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,480
Speaker 0: I take albuterol.

100
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,700
Speaker 0: Do you just take that as needed?

101
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,420
Speaker 0: And do you take any other medications?

102
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 1: I take a loratadine or a claritin for allergies.

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,380
Speaker 0: Okay.

104
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,540
Speaker 0: What about any herbal supplements, vitamins?

105
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,000
Speaker 1: I take a multivitamin.

106
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,260
Speaker 0: And I always like to ask all my patients, any recreational drug use?

107
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,260
Speaker 1: No, none.

108
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,240
Speaker 0: And are you allergic to any medication?

109
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,120
Speaker 1: I am.

110
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,680
Speaker 1: I'm allergic to penicillin.

111
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,940
Speaker 0: And what happens when you take penicillin?

112
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,920
Speaker 1: I break out in a rash.

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,920
Speaker 0: Well, we'd be sure never to give you penicillin for anything.

114
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,300
Speaker 0: And as far as family history, any medical conditions in the family with your mom and dad?

115
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,960
Speaker 1: My mom... She's pretty healthy.

116
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,220
Speaker 1: She has diabetes though, and it's pretty under control.

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,820
Speaker 1: My dad has high cholesterol, but he takes medicine for that.

118
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,540
Speaker 0: Any brothers or sisters?

119
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,260
Speaker 1: I have a brother and he's healthy.

120
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,400
Speaker 1: He doesn't have any conditions or anything.

121
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,600
Speaker 0: And no one's ever had problems with joints or arthritis?

122
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,080
Speaker 1: No.

123
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,900
Speaker 2: Great.

124
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,220
Speaker 0: And I always like to just get an overview of my patients, kind of get to know them a little better.

125
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,560
Speaker 0: What do you do for a living?

126
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,580
Speaker 1: I'm an administrative assistant.

127
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,800
Speaker 2: Oh, where do you work?

128
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,680
Speaker 1: I work for the Fish and Wildlife Services.

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,620
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,460
Speaker 0: That must be fun.

131
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,140
Speaker 0: You've been doing it for a while?

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, for a few years.

134
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,580
Speaker 0: Stressful or pretty?

135
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,020
Speaker 1: It's not very stressful at all.

136
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,160
Speaker 0: That's good.

137
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,860
Speaker 0: And are you married?

138
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,420
Speaker 1: I am.

139
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

140
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,620
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

141
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,220
Speaker 1: Thanks.

142
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,160
Speaker 0: Do you have any children?

143
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Speaker 1: No, not yet.

144
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:18,940
Speaker 1: No children?

145
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,140
Speaker 1: No.

146
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,720
Speaker 2: Alright.

147
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Speaker 0: And so do you have hobbies that you like to do?

148
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,300
Speaker 1: I do.

149
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,800
Speaker 1: I like to cook and I like to garden.

150
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,100
Speaker 1: It's been kind of difficult to garden because I can't lean forward as much for the past two days.

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it can be frustrating when you can't do the things you enjoy.

152
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,300
Speaker 0: Any tobacco use?

154
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,780
Speaker 1: I smoke probably maybe half a pack a day, if that.

155
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,420
Speaker 0: And how long have you been smoking?

156
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,400
Speaker 1: Oh, I want to say maybe seven years or so.

157
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,220
Speaker 0: OK.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Speaker 0: Any alcohol use?

159
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,760
Speaker 1: Occasional.

160
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,320
Speaker 1: I'll have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week.

161
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,240
Speaker 2: OK.

162
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:14,560
Speaker 0: Well, I believe I got all the information I needed from you, so we're gonna go ahead and move on to the physical exam portion.

163
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,680
Speaker 0: So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna have you take a seat up here.

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 0: All right, for the physical exam, I'm gonna go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs and make sure those sound nice and clear.

165
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,940
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna slide this down and just breathe normal.

166
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,160
Speaker 0: And go and take a big deep breath.

167
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,760
Speaker 0: And again.

168
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:51,920
Speaker 1: Again.

169
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,240
Speaker 0: And last one.

170
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,660
Speaker 0: Good.

171
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,220
Speaker 0: And so I'm just gonna do a structural exam here and palpate down your spine.

172
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
Speaker 0: Let me know if there's anything that's tender.

173
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,600
Speaker 1: It's tender everywhere.

174
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
Speaker 0: Everywhere, okay.

175
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna work my way down.

176
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,940
Speaker 0: And I want to check the range of motion in your neck.

177
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,660
Speaker 0: So what I want you to do is try to put your chin down to your chest.

178
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,460
Speaker 1: It's about as far as I can go.

179
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,900
Speaker 0: And then looking up to the ceiling, pretty stiff.

180
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,380
Speaker 0: OK.

181
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,540
Speaker 0: And what about looking, turning and looking over to this shoulder?

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,040
Speaker 0: OK.

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:41,780
Speaker 0: All right.

184
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,580
Speaker 0: And turn and look to that shoulder for me.

185
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,700
Speaker 0: Right there.

186
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,380
Speaker 0: And then ear to your shoulder.

187
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,060
Speaker 0: Trying to touch your ear over to your shoulder.

188
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,880
Speaker 0: And then ear to the other shoulder.

189
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,780
Speaker 0: That's as far as I know.

190
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,900
Speaker 0: Okay, alright.

191
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,340
Speaker 0: And I'm going to go ahead and check just some reflexes.

192
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,480
Speaker 0: This will kind of tell me if there's any nerves that are involved.

193
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,580
Speaker 0: So just relax your arm.

194
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,200
Speaker 0: And we're going to rest your arm right here on your back.

195
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,340
Speaker 0: And just relax.

196
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,780
Speaker 0: And I'm gonna do the same thing on this arm.

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,300
Speaker 0: So just relax your arm.

198
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,100
Speaker 0: And just relax.

199
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,680
Speaker 0: And then last one, just let your arm hang.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,860
Speaker 0: And now I'm gonna test and see how strong you are.

201
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,600
Speaker 0: So place your arms like this for me, and don't let me move your arms.

202
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,260
Speaker 2: Good.

203
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,060
Speaker 0: And arms up, and don't let me push them.

204
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,000
Speaker 0: Good and fingers out for me.

205
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,240
Speaker 0: Don't let me squeeze them and fingers together and try to push them out.

206
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,120
Speaker 0: All right, if it's okay with you as an osteopathic student we've learned some treatments.

207
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,780
Speaker 0: So I'm going to do some soft tissue to try and break up some of this tension that you're having.

208
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,080
Speaker 0: if that sounds okay No, it's not gonna hurt.

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Speaker 0: and if there's any pain I want you to let me know.

210
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,460
Speaker 0: And so I'm just going to do Just very gentle, it's called myofascial.

211
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,840
Speaker 0: And just kind of slowly up.

212
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:37,100
Speaker 0: And if this is something that you do get some relief from after this evening, then you can come back and we can be a little more aggressive.

213
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,980
Speaker 0: But since the car accident was just two days ago, I want to be very gentle.

214
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,180
Speaker 0: I'm just going to hold this right here.

215
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Speaker 0: All those muscles that are tight and spasming right now attach right up where my fingers are at, so I'm just trying to get them to relax and loosen.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,080
Speaker 1: So this is supposed to relax all the muscles in your neck?

217
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,180
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, yep.

218
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,760
Speaker 0: I think that'll be enough for today.

219
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,840
Speaker 0: I don't want to do too much since it was such an acute injury.

220
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,860
Speaker 0: So I'm going to go ahead and help you up.

221
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,800
Speaker 0: And then I'm going to go ahead and summarize everything that you told me from earlier, if that's okay.

222
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,360
Speaker 0: Would you prefer sitting back down in the chair?

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:33,860
Speaker 0: Sure.

224
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,820
Speaker 0: Okay, so you started having some neck pain two days ago after a motor vehicle accident.

225
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,340
Speaker 0: You were rear-ended, but you were wearing your seat belt.

226
00:12:47,940 --> 00:13:01,600
Speaker 0: You didn't hear any pop or have any numbness or tingling that occurred, and it's just been real tight for the past two days, real constant, but it's worse whenever you flex your head down or turn to the left.

227
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Speaker 0: Is that correct?

228
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:02,900
Speaker 0: Yes.

229
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,100
Speaker 0: And as far as your past medical history, you just have asthma and you're taking some medication for that.

230
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,480
Speaker 2: Okay.

231
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,340
Speaker 0: And you're not allergic to anything.

232
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,400
Speaker 1: Penicillin.

233
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,800
Speaker 0: Excuse me.

234
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,460
Speaker 0: Yes, that's right.

235
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,920
Speaker 0: You are allergic to penicillin.

236
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:17,820
Speaker 0: All right.

237
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,980
Speaker 0: What I will do is I will go talk to Dr.

238
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,880
Speaker 0: Parrot and then we will be back in to put together a treatment option plan for you.

239
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,940
Speaker 0: Okay.

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Speaker 0: Any other questions or concerns you have for me today?

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,460
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

242
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,320
Speaker 1: Just want to feel better.

243
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,000
Speaker 1: All right.
